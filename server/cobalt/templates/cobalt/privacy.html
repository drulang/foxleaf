			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Your privacy is very important to us. At FoxLeaf&nbsp;we have a few fundamental principles:</p><ul>  <li>    <p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</p>  </li>    <li>        <p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  </p>  </li>    <li>        <p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p>  </li></ul><h2>Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, FoxLeaf collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our&nbsp;visitors use its website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p><p>FoxLeaf also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to FoxLeaf's websites choose to interact with FoxLeaf in ways that require FoxLeaf to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that FoxLeaf gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account&nbsp;to provide a username and email address. In each case, FoxLeaf collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with FoxLeaf. FoxLeaf does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2><p>FoxLeaf may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. FoxLeaf may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, FoxLeaf does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p><h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>FoxLeaf discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on FoxLeaf's behalf or to provide services available at FoxLeaf's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using FoxLeaf's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. FoxLeaf will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, FoxLeaf discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when FoxLeaf believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FoxLeaf, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the&nbsp;FoxLeaf website and have supplied your email address, FoxLeaf may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with FoxLeaf and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. FoxLeaf takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. FoxLeaf uses cookies to help FoxLeaf identify and track visitors, their usage of FoxLeaf website, and their website access preferences. FoxLeaf visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using FoxLeaf's websites, with the drawback that certain features of FoxLeaf's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p><h2>Business Transfers</h2><p>If FoxLeaf, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that FoxLeaf goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of FoxLeaf may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><h2>Ads</h2><p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by FoxLeaf and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p><h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, FoxLeaf may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in FoxLeaf's&nbsp;sole discretion. FoxLeaf encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p><p>This Privacy Policy was crafted from <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/" rel="nofollow">Wordpress's&nbsp;version</a>, which is available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. Although this policy is not unique, we share the same beliefs as Automattic.</p>
